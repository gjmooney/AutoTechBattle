# Design Patterns
The rough idea so far is to use the Strategy behavioral pattern to implement the different attacks and spells the tech giants can use. 
I will use the Decorator pattern to implement the differnet evolutions of the start-ups. New evolutions will grant new stat bonuses and access to more spells.
Maybe a factory for different tech giant/start up types.
